# AI-Assisted Knowledge Quiz

## 1. Project Setup & Demo

### Web
Run the following commands to launch the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

(Note: `npm start` is aliased to `vite` in this project).

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

## 2. Problem Understanding

The goal was to create an interactive quiz application where the content (questions and feedback) is dynamically generated by AI based on a user-selected topic.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Topic Selection:** Allow users to choose or input a topic.
- **AI Generation:** Fetch 5 MCQs from an AI service (simulated for this demo).
- **Quiz Interface:** Navigate through questions, select answers, and track progress.
- **Feedback:** Provide a score and AI-generated personalized feedback upon completion.
- **Robustness:** Handle errors and ensure consistent data structure (JSON).

**Assumptions:**
- Since no API key was provided, the AI service is **simulated** with mock data and delays to mimic the user experience.
- The application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and TypeScript.

## 3. AI Prompts & Iterations

To ensure the AI returns consistent JSON that the app can parse, the following prompt structure is designed (and documented in `src/services/aiService.ts`):

### Question Generation Prompt
```text
Generate 5 multiple-choice questions about "${topic}".
Return the response in the following JSON format:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id",
    "text": "Question text",
    "options": [
      { "id": "a", "text": "Option A" },
      { "id": "b", "text": "Option B" },
      { "id": "c", "text": "Option C" },
      { "id": "d", "text": "Option D" }
    ],
    "correctOptionId": "id_of_correct_option"
  }
]
```

### Feedback Generation Prompt
```text
The user scored ${score} out of ${total} on a quiz about "${topic}".
Generate a short, encouraging, and personalized feedback message (max 2 sentences).
```

**Iterations:**
- *Initial thought:* Just ask for questions. *Issue:* Format varies (numbered lists, plain text), making parsing hard.
- *Refinement:* Explicitly requested JSON schema. Added `id` fields for stable rendering and answer tracking.

## 4. Architecture & Code Structure

The project uses **React** with **TypeScript** and **Vite**.

- **`src/App.tsx`**: Main controller. Manages the global state (`QuizState`) and orchestrates the flow between screens (Topic -> Loading -> Quiz -> Feedback).
- **`src/services/aiService.ts`**: Encapsulates the AI logic. Currently mocks the API call but is structured to easily swap in `fetch` or an SDK call.
- **`src/components/`**:
  - `TopicSelection.tsx`: Entry screen for user input.
  - `QuizLoader.tsx`: Visual feedback during "generation".
  - `QuizDisplay.tsx`: Reusable component for rendering a single question with navigation and progress.
  - `Feedback.tsx`: Summary screen with score and AI message.
- **`src/types.ts`**: Shared TypeScript interfaces (`Question`, `QuizState`, etc.) to ensure type safety across the app.

## 5. Bonus Work

- **Responsive Design:** The UI is fully responsive and works on mobile and desktop.
- **Dark Mode:** The app uses a dark theme by default for a modern look.
- **Animations:** Added simple CSS animations for the loader and feedback screen entry.
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bar during the quiz.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error states for failed generation (simulated).
